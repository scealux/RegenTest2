        <p>
            In 1910, approximately <strong class ="green">one in seven farmers</strong> were African-American. In the century that followed, there has been a 90% loss of black-owned farmland in the US. As of 2017, <strong class ="green"> black farmers make up just 1.3% </strong> of all producers.

          The USDA 2017 Census of Agriculture defines a producer as “a person who is involved in making decisions for the farm operation. Decisions may include decisions about such things as planting, harvesting, livestock management, and marketing”. Demographic data were collected for up to four producers per farm. Each farm has at least one principle producer.

          The United States has a long history of discrimination against Black farmers.
        </h2>
        <p>
          As of 2017, black farmers make up <strong class ="green"> just 1.3% of all producers, </strong> even though <strong class ="green"> 13.4% of the US’s population </strong> is black. Black farmers struggle in a system where they don’t have equal access to federal relief, less access to credit. This systemic racism dates back to the early 1900s and continues today. This is despite numerous reports finding the USDA and other organizations guilty of racial discrimination.

                  <h3>The Agricultural Adjustment Act</h3>
                  <p>
                    During President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) was established to restore agricultural prosperity during the great depression. Committees were formed that often were made up of white landowners who were interested in obtaining more farmlands for themselves. Black farmers were often excluded from serving on these committees and thus struggled to challenge the decisions made by the committees in their areas. This program created a structure that allowed those in power to allot less land to African American farmers.

                    Farmers Home Administration (FHA), a USDA program, systematically discriminated against farmers by denying them loans. In many cases, this limited the crops that could be grown and thus restricted financial growth.

                    By 1999, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of all black farmers. The result was an agreement to pay $50,000 to each black farmer that participated in the class action. Over 85% of eligible farms never received this money, as they did not know of the settlement in time. Many lost their farms or died before receiving their settlement.

                    The Trump administration announced a subsidy program to help farmers during America’s trade war with China. This program has been criticized for disproportionately benefiting wealthy landowners, thus worsening the disadvantages of minority-owned farms. White business owners received 99.5% of these subsidies, overlooking many of the small farm owners who needed it most.
